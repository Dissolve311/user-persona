He started his career as a Monitor Engineer for musical acts and -similar to others who have had this role - eventually was expected to also manage the wireless systems for the production. He is adamant that multiple tools are required to provide effective and reliable coordination.","special_notes":"In some countries, there is no RF coordinator position, so who will do the RF coordination? In China for example, if the channel counts are big, people may ask the manufacturer like Shure for help. In Japan, usually people do not charge customers for RF coordination service as they see this as a \"we got your back\" and trying to have better customer engagement.\n \nUsually in large PA companies, there are 2-3 experts who can coordinate more than 20ch. When they are not doing RF coordination they are working as monitor engineers or stage person.\n"},{"name":"Ema","job":"FOH Engineer","pic":"https://womeninlivemusic.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/siundgym.png","quote":"Art and Tech, I own both","age":24,"location":"UK","experience":"6 years","education":"College","skills":"Stage wiring, mixing, sound production, signal flow","goals":"Create the tonal picture that is desired.Ensure that both performers and audience members hear what they need to.","painpoints":"Communication with a lot of people; Mix a sound that meets the level requirements but also tasteful and artful; Heavy mental work; Technical issues is terrifying during the show; Microphones may be too close to the PA","products":"Mixing Console; Wired/ Wireless microphones; Audio snake","responsibilities":"FOH stands for Front of House and the FOH Engineer.

She found a Soundcraft Powerstation, some JBL speakers, and a bunch of Shure 58s in the school music department and took it from there (with some encouragement from the school Head of Music).\nDuring her time at the school, I ran sound for the annual school performance of 'Much Ado About Nothing' at the Kings Theatre in Portsmouth and later continued to run two weeks of 'Joseph' at the Havant Arts Centre. One year later, with driving licence in hand, she had a Martin Audio system in a van and began working with an ABBA tribute band. She never stopped working as a FOH mixer during her college time. Although she didn't pursue a degree in audio engineering, she worked with the band almost every holiday. Now FOH engineer is her full-time job."}]
