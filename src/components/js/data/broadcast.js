For example, broadcasting sports event or live TV show, they might need to mic up hosts, guests, make sure that the ambient sound is picked up. But in a concert/music event, mic up might not be necessary. Similar to Touring, the workflow is realtively set but every event requires adaptation to the environment and situations."}]
